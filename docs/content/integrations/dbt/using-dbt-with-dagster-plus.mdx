# Guide: Using dbt with Dagster+

<Note>
  <strong>Note</strong>: This guide focuses on serverless deployments in
  Dagster+. For more information about hybrid deployments, visit this{" "}

</Note>

This guide helps you getting started with dbt in Dagster+. Importing an existing dbt project in Dagster+ allows you to automatically load your dbt models as Dagster assets. This can be be done with an existing dbt project, that is not already using Dagster, or a Dagster project in which your dbt project is included.

## Import your dbt project to Dagster+

Using Dagster+ Serverless, importing a dbt project to create a new Dagster project and deploy your code location is as easy as it gets. After browsing to Deployment > Code Locations > Add code location, choosing the option "Import a dbt project" allows you to import the Git repo of your dbt project.

### Example: import a dbt project from a GitHub repo

Importing a dbt project can be done in a few steps only. Using GitHub to select the repository of a dbt project and deploy it to Dagster+ is a very common use case. Let's walk through the steps.

After clicking on "Continue" on the main page of "Import a dbt project", you'll be prompted to connect with either GitHub or GitLab. For this example, let's select GitHub.

This action will redirect you to the GitHub website, where you'll be asked to authorize the Dagster+ application. Keep in mind that the profile or organization authorizing Dagster+ should have the read and write access for the repository containing the dbt project to be imported.

width={2168}
height={830}
/>

#### Select and deploy the repo

Once the authorization completed, search the repositories and select the one containing the dbt project to be imported.

Before continuing, make sure that the repository is a valid dbt project - the [dbt_project.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml) and [profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/profiles.yml) files are required for the deployment process. An error message will be displayed if these files are missing.

When the correct repository is selected, click "Continue". Note that this process will update your repository by opening a new pull request, which will contain the Dagster files required to deploy the dbt project to Dagster+.

height={1492}
/>

#### Review the state of the repo

When deploying a dbt project for the first time, the workflow uses the `dagster-dbt scaffold` command to create a Dagster project matching the dbt one. Once this process is completed, the workflow opens a pull request in the repository so that you can review the newly generated code and merge it to the production branch.

This process updates the file structure of the repository. let's take a look at the differences before and after the changes.

Before the changes, a typical dbt project would include files like dbt_project.yml, profiles.yml, dbt models in `.sql` format and sbt seeds in `.csv` format. Considering that this is a Git repository, other files may be included, like `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

```shell
my_dbt_project
├── models
│   ├── my_model.sql
├── seeds
│   ├── my_seeds.csv
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dbt_project.yml
└── profiles.yml
```

After the changes, new files and folders are added to the repository. A [dagster_cloud.yaml file](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) is added, which defines your code location for Dagster+. Two cloud action files are added under `.github/workflows`, `branch_deployments.yml` and `deploy.yml`, to manage the deployments of the repository. last but not least, all the Dagster files are added in a folder named after your repository. These are mostly Python files and add the required code base to run your dbt project with Dagster.

```shell
my_dbt_project
├── .github
│   ├── workflows
│   │   ├── branch_deployments.yml
│   │   ├── deploy.yml
├── models
│   ├── my_model.sql
├── my_dbt_project
│   ├── my_dbt_project
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── assets.py
│   │   ├── definitions.py
│   │   ├── project.py
│   │   ├── schedules.py
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   ├── setup.py
├── seeds
│   ├── my_seeds.csv
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dagster_cloud.yaml
├── dbt_project.yml
└── profiles.yml
```

## Import your dbt & Dagster project to Dagster+

If a Dagster project already created for your dbt project, you may want to import it directly in Dagster+. After browsing to Deployment > Code Locations > Add code location, choosing the option "Import a Dagster project" allows you to import the Git repo of your dbt & Dagster project.

### Example: import a dbt & Dagster project from a GitHub repo

Importing a dbt & Dagster project is quick and easy using the "Import a Dagster project" option. Let's look at how to do it using GitHub.

On the main page of "Import a Dagster project", you can choose to connect to GitHub or GitLab. For this example, let's select GitHub.

This action will redirect you to the GitHub website, where you'll be asked to authorize the Dagster+ application. Keep in mind that the profile or organization authorizing Dagster+ should have the read and write access for the repository containing the dbt & Dagster project to be imported.

#### Select and deploy the repo

Once the authorization completed, search the repositories and select the one containing the dbt & Dagster project to be imported.

Before continuing, make sure that the repository contains the required files for dbt and Dagster. For dbt, the [dbt_project.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml) and [profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/profiles.yml) files are required for the deployment process. For Dagster, your project requires a `pyproject.toml` file with the information about where to find your Dagster definitions. For more information about the `pyproject.toml` file, read our [guide about code locations](/concepts/code-locations).

When the correct repository is selected, click "Continue". Note that this process will update your repository by adding directly new files to your default branch.

#### Update the cloud action files

When importing a project in Dagster+ using the "Import a Dagster Project" feature, various files are added to the repository containing the project, including the cloud action files. These files are optimized for general use in Dagster projects, but require some attention when the Dagster project includes a dbt component. Once these files are updated, the dbt & Dagster project will be successfully deployed to Dagster+.

Follow these steps to update the cloud action files. Note that in this example, the dbt project directory in the repository is called `dbt` and the [adapter used by dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/connect-adapters) is DuckDB. Depending on your dbt & Dagster project, you might need to update the code.

1. In your Dagster project, locate the `.github/workflows` directory.

2. Open the `deploy.yml` file.

3. Locate the Checkout for Python Executable Deploy step, which should be on or near line 38.

4. Add

```
- name: Parse dbt project and package with Dagster project
  if: steps.prerun.outputs.result == 'pex-deploy'
  run: |
    pip install pip --upgrade
    pip install dbt-duckdb
    cd project-repo/dbt
    dbt deps
    dbt parse
  shell: bash
```

5. Open the `branch_deployments.yml` file, then repeat steps 3 and 4.

#### Review the state of the repo

When deploying a Dagster project for the first time, the workflow adds various files - a [dagster_cloud.yaml file](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml), if it is missing, and two cloud action files under `.github/workflows`, `branch_deployments.yml` and `deploy.yml`, to manage the deployments of the repository.

After adding the files to the repository, a typical file structure would include the required files for dbt and Dagster, some files related to Git, like `.gitignore`, and the newly added files.

```shell
my_dbt_and_dagster_project
├── .github
│   ├── workflows
│   │   ├── branch_deployments.yml
│   │   ├── deploy.yml
├── dbt
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── my_model.sql
│   ├── seeds
│   │   ├── my_seeds.csv
│   ├── dbt_project.yml
│   ├── profiles.yml
├── my_dbt_and_dagster_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── assets.py
│   ├── definitions.py
│   ├── project.py
│   ├── schedules.py
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dagster_cloud.yaml
├── pyproject.toml
└── setup.py
```

## Understanding the cloud action files

The cloud action files added to your repository when importing a project are essential - they manage the deployments to Dagster+. While the files added through the "Import a dbt project" workflow are ready to use, those added through the "Import a Dagster project" workflow requires some attention when importing a dbt & Dagster project. Let's take a closer look at the differences between the files and the required steps for a dbt project.
